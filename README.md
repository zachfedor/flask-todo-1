# Flask To-Do

A simple to-do application written in Python using the [Flask web framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).


## Instructions

You and a partner will work together to complete the [user stories in the documentation folder](doc/user-stories.md).


## Installation

Fork this repo and use `git clone` to get a copy of your fork on your local machine, then create and activate a virtual environment to install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd flask-todo
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Flask's environment variables can be set by running:

```sh
$ source bin/env.sh
```

Then you can run the shell script provided to create the database for the application:

```sh
$ sh bin/create-db.sh
```

To create the tables, you can run the following command. You'll need to run this again for any changes to `schema.sql`.

```sh
$ flask init-db
```

Mock data is stored in `tests/data.sql` and will be inserted into the test database for every test. If you would like to use the same data when developing, you can run this command to insert it into the development database.

```sh
$ flask mock-db
```


## Running the Application Locally

```sh
$ flask run
```

You should be able to view the app at [http://localhost:5000]().
